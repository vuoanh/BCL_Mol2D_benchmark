# BCL_Mol2D_benchmark
This repo contains scripts to perform the benchmark and sensitivity analysis in the paper *BCL::Mol2D â€“ a robust atom environment descriptor for QSAR modeling and lead optimization*

## 1. Download and install BCL

The **Bio Chemical Library (BCL)** is a software package that provides a suite of cheminformatics tools that allow construction of quantitative structure-activity-relation (QSAR) models for virtual screening, pharmacophore mapping, and drug design. BCL is free of charge for non-comercial use.
If you want to build BCL from the source code, follow the instruction on [this page](http://meilerlab.org/index.php/servers/bcl-academic-license) to obtain access to the source code of BCL.

## 2. Benchmark different descriptor configurations in QSAR tasks

## 3.Sensitivity analysis
